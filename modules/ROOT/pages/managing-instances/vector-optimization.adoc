== Overview

Vector optimization reserves memory for vector indexes, enhancing performance for vector-based operations. 
It is available for AuraDB instances with more than 4GB of memory.

Enable vector optimization using a toggle during instance setup. 
This configuration may increase memory use, which could impact performance for other queries.

== Enabling vector optimization

Enable vector optimization during *instance creation* under the following conditions:

- *Minimum instance size*: 4GB RAM or higher
- *Supported version*: Neo4j 5 only
- *Cloud provider and region*: Available across all supported providers and regions

=== Steps to enable vector optimization

. *Start instance creation*: Choose your AuraDB tier and instance size. (Only instances *4GB and above* support vector optimization.)
. *Additional settings*: After selecting the instance details, expand *Additional Settings* to discover the *Vector-optimized configuration* toggle.

==== Configuration status in instance details

You can view the vector configuration status in *Instance Details*, where it will display as either “Yes” or “No.”

==== Instance Resizing 

Lowering the instance size below 4GB will automatically disable vector optimization.

==== Cloning and Vector Optimization

Neo4j Aura offers two cloning options, with different behaviors for configuration inheritance:

* *Clone to New:* Cloned instances inherit the vector optimization settings of the original instance.
* *Clone to Existing:* Cloned instances *do not* inherit the original instance's vector optimization settings.
