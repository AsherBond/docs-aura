== Snapshots

The data in your instance can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots.
A snapshot is a copy of the data in an instance at a specific point in time.

Neo4j regularly takes snapshots of your instance, and you can request a snapshot to be taken on demand.
These snapshots can be used to restore data to a different Neo4j instance.

== Graph Data Science plugin 

label:AuraDB-Professional[]

The Graph Data Science plugin allows you to access the GDS library in your Aura instance.
It is available for AuraDB Professional instances running version 5, with more than 4GB of memory, and across all supported cloud providers and regions. 
The plugin requires approximately 300mb of memory when running or paused, therefore you can enable or disable it when necessary. 

For more information about the GDS library, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/introduction/[The Graph Data Science documentation].


// == Import instance

// _Feature coming soon!_

// == Logs

// If something goes wrong, the logs are a good place to start.
// The standard log is called `neo4j.log` and it contains general information about Neo4j.
// There is one for each DBMS and it can be accessed directly from Desktop via the Developer menu. It opens in a separate window, which allows you to keep it in the background.
