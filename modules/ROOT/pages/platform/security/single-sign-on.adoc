== SSO levels

Organization owners and admins can configure one or more Single Sign-On (SSO) login methods for user authentication. 
SSO enables users to authenticate through an Identity Provider (IdP) for access to an organization or instances within a project.

There are two configuration options: *Organization SSO* and *Instance SSO*. 
Note that role mapping is a feature exclusive to Instance SSO.

=== SSO Org level roles

The following roles are available at the organization level and these are assigned via invitation:

* Owner
* Admin
* Member

== Log-in methods

Log-in methods are different for each SSO level.
Administrators can configure a combination of one or more of the log-in methods.

*Org SSO supports:*

* Email/password
* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID
* Google SSO (not Google Workspace SSO)

An organization's administrator can add Aura as a log-in from a tile in an organization's Apps Dashboard.

*Project SSO supports:*

* User/password
* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID


However, at the project level you cannot disable user/password, but at the org level you can disable email/password and Google SSO as long as you have at least one other custom SSO provider configured.

== Setup requirements

Accessing Aura with SSO requires:

* Authorization Code Flow
* A publicly accessible IdP server

To create an SSO Configuration either a Discovery URI or a combination of Issuer, Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint and JWKS URI is required.

== Create a new SSO configuration

From the *Organization settings*, go to *Single Sign-On* and use the *SSO Configuration* button to set up a new SSO configuration.

The checkboxes *Use as a log in for the Organization* and *Use as login method for instances with projects in this Org* define whether SSO should be only on Organization level, only on Project level, or both.

The required basic SSO configuration information can be retrieved from the IdP.
Entering the Discovery URI pre-fills the fields below. 
If this is not known these fields can be completed manually.

== Individual instance level SSO configurations available from Support

Support can assist with:

* Role mapping specific to a database instance
* Custom groups claim besides `groups`
* Updating SSO on already running instances
