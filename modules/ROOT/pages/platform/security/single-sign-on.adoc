= Single Sign-On (SSO)
:description: SSO allows you to log in to the Aura Console using their company IdP credentials.

label:AuraDB-Virtual-Dedicated-Cloud[]
label:AuraDS-Enterprise[]
label:AuraDB-Business-Critical[]

Organization owners and admins can configure one or more login methods.

Single sign-on (SSO) allows you to use an IdP to authenticate users for accessing an organization or an instance within the Aura console.

== Login methods

*1. Organization SSO*

* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID
* Email/password
* Google SSO (not Google Workspace SSO) 

You can disable email/password and Google SSO if Okta or Microsoft Entra ID are configured.

When you have set up organization SSO, the organization SSO link is available in the Organization Settings > Summary section of the Aura console. 
For easy access, you could add Aura as a login option from a tile in the organization’s Apps Dashboard.

*2. Instance SSO*

* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID

// Setting up Okta or Microsoft Entra ID prevents user/password from being disabled (you wouldn't be able to disable it anyway right?)
// The user/password is downloaded when you create the instance. 
// It's different to the email/password.
// TEST THIS!

Instance SSO does not apply to instances created before SSO was enabled. 

== Setup requirements

Accessing Aura with SSO requires:

* Authorization Code Flow
* A publicly accessible IdP server

To create an SSO Configuration either a Discovery URI or a combination of Issuer, Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint and JWKS URI is required.

== Create a new SSO configuration

From the *Organization settings*, go to *Single Sign-On* and use the *SSO Configuration* button to set up a new SSO configuration.

The checkboxes *Use as a log in for the Organization* and *Use as login method for instances with projects in this Org* define whether SSO should be only on Organization level, only on Project level, or both.

The required basic SSO configuration information can be retrieved from the IdP.
Entering the Discovery URI pre-fills the fields below. 
If this is not known these fields can be completed manually.

== Individual instance level SSO configurations available from Support

Support can assist with:

* Role mapping specific to a database instance
* Custom groups claim besides `groups`
* Updating SSO on already running instances

If you require support assistance, visit link:https://support.neo4j.com/[Customer Support] and raise a support ticket including the following information:


. The _Project ID_ of the projects you want to use SSO for.
See xref:platform/user-management.adoc#_projects[Projects] for more information on how to find your __Project ID__.

. The name of your IdP

== Authorization vs. Authentication

*Authentication* determines who is allowed in. 
Authentication is handled by Single Sign-On (SSO), which serves as a method for logging in. 

*Authorization* determines what someone can do when they have logged-in.
Access privileges beyond login are managed through roles using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) an authorization method. 

SSO does not directly grant access to edit project settings—such as changing the project name, managing network access, or modifying instance settings like renaming, pausing, or resuming an instance. 
To determine a user’s access rights to these features, you should use RBAC.

Roles and permissions are managed by RBAC, which decides whether a user can access, view, or modify data within the database instances themselves. 
At this level, role mapping can be utilized to grant users different levels of access based on their roles in their Identity Provider (IdP).

=== RBAC determined roles related to SSO

//I don't quite follow this? where are these roles assigned? They are not assigned at SSO config level?//

The following roles can be assigned via invitation:

* Owner
* Admin
* Member

== Log in flow for users when Organization SSO is enabled

. A user opens the Aura console and selects Continue with {SSO name}
. The user is redirected to the external IdP
. The user authenticates successfully with the IdP
. The user is redirected to the Aura console, to the relevant project
