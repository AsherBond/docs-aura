== SSO options

* *Use as a login method for the organization:* 
* *Use as a log-in method for instances within Projects in this organization:* Note that access is only automatically granted for new database instances created within that project since the setting was enabled. 


== Log-in methods

Administrators can configure a combination of one or more of the log-in methods.

=== "Use as a login method for the organization" supports:

* Email/password
* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID
* Google SSO (not Google Workspace SSO)

Admins can disable email/password and Google SSO as long as one other custom SSO provider is configured.
An organization's administrator can add Aura as a log-in from a tile in an organization's Apps Dashboard.

=== "Use as a log-in method for instances within Projects in this organization" supports:

* User/password
* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID

With this enabled, you cannot disable user/password.

== Setup requirements

Accessing Aura with SSO requires:

* Authorization Code Flow
* A publicly accessible IdP server

To create an SSO Configuration either a Discovery URI or a combination of Issuer, Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint and JWKS URI is required.

== Create a new SSO configuration

From the *Organization settings*, go to *Single Sign-On* and use the *SSO Configuration* button to set up a new SSO configuration.

The checkboxes *Use as a log in for the Organization* and *Use as login method for instances with projects in this Org* define whether SSO should be only on Organization level, only on Project level, or both.

The required basic SSO configuration information can be retrieved from the IdP.
Entering the Discovery URI pre-fills the fields below. 
If this is not known these fields can be completed manually.

== Individual instance level SSO configurations available from Support

Support can assist with:

* Role mapping specific to a database instance
* Custom groups claim besides `groups`
* Updating SSO on already running instances

If you require support assistance, visit link:https://support.neo4j.com/[Customer Support] and raise a support ticket including the following information:


. The _Project ID_ of the projects you want to use SSO for.
See xref:platform/user-management.adoc#_projects[Projects] for more information on how to find your __Project ID__.

. The name of your IdP

== Authorization vs. Authentication

Authorization
Authorization determines who is allowed in. (SSO)
Authentication
 	Determines what someone can do when they are in. (RBAC)

RBAC Access privileges beyond log-in are managed via xref:http//:login.neo4j.com[roles.]
Authentication: SSO is an authentication method / log-in method and access, roles, and permissions are dictated by role-based access control (RBAC).
SSO does not directly give access to edit the project settings, for example to edit the project name, network access, or to edit the instance settings such as to rename an instance, or pause and resume - instead to determine the user's access rights, you should use RBAC which is an authorization method.

Roles and permissions are managed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). 
It depends on RBAC if the user can access and view or modify data within the database instances themselves. 
For this level, the role mapping may be used to grant users different levels of access based on a role in their identity provider (IdP). 


=== RBAC SSO roles

//I don't quite follow this? where are these roles assigned? They are not assigned at SSO config level?//

The following roles can be assigned via invitation:

* Owner
* Admin
* Member
