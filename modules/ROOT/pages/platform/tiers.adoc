= Overview of tiers

[NOTE]
====
You can request a time limited trial of any tier to experience it in full.
====

Neo4j offers multiple tiers to choose from, ensuring that your usage fits your organization’s specific requirements. 
Each successive edition builds on the previous edition through the addition of tier-specific features and/or higher levels of service. 
As your organization’s needs change and grow, changing tiers is easy.

The Aura tier that your organization chooses determines the unit costs for the credits and the data storage you use. 

* On Demand: Usage-based pricing with no long-term licensing requirements.
* Capacity: Discounted pricing based on an upfront Capacity commitment.

== AuraDB Free

AuraDB Free is our introductory level offering, providing full, unlimited access to all of Aura’s standard features. 
It provides a strong balance between features, level of support, and cost.
For small development projects, learning, experimentation, and prototyping.

== AuraDB Professional

For medium-scale applications in advanced development or production environments.

== AuraDB MTE

* The architecture for MTE positions private low level infrastructure (Kubernetes Pods) on a shared compute resource (Kubernetes Node) to achieve multi-tenancy. 
* The Kubernetes Pods have a private persistent volume attached to them in a 1:1 relationship. 
* This relationship provides a layer of security as the data residing on the volume can only be accessed from a specific Kubernetes Pod. 

=== MTE is for:



=== MTE is not for:

* Organisations with strict data segregation requirements that mandate physical isolation to preserve data integrity, or that require compliance with FedRAMP.  
* Organisations that need to use highly customised features that are not suited to a multi-tenant environment, such as custom procedures.


== AuraDB Enterprise

* Where a customer is guaranteed resource isolation. 
* Orchestras are expensive to run, especially so in a single tenant architecture, therefore AuraDB Enterprise has premium pricing.


=== AuraDB Enterprise is for:

* For large-scale, mission-critical applications that require advanced security and 24x7 support.
* Organisations that require the highest level of uptime SLA.
