= Overview of tiers

*Flexible options to fit your needs:*
Neo4j offers a range of plans to suit your organization's specific requirements.  
Each plan builds on the previous one, providing additional features or higher levels of service.  
If your needs change, you can easily switch plans to keep pace.

The Aura tier that you choose determines the unit costs for the credits and the data storage you use. 

* *Pay as you go:*
Perfect for unpredictable usage, with on-demand pricing and no long-term contracts.

* *Commit to a capacity reservation:* 
For upfront pricing on credits and storage.

For pricing details, see the link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/[pricing page] on the Neo4j website.

====
You can request a time limited trial of any tier to experience it in full.

For medium-scale applications in advanced development or production environments.

== AuraDB MTE

* 99.9% uptime SLA

*MTE overview* 

* The architecture for MTE positions private low level infrastructure (Kubernetes Pods) on a shared compute resource (Kubernetes Node) to achieve multi-tenancy. 
* The Kubernetes Pods have a private persistent volume attached to them in a 1:1 relationship. 
* This relationship provides a layer of security as the data residing on the volume can only be accessed from a specific Kubernetes Pod. 


== AuraDB Enterprise

* Where a customer is guaranteed resource isolation. 
* Orchestras are expensive to run, especially so in a single tenant architecture, therefore AuraDB Enterprise has premium pricing.

*AuraDB Enterprise is for:*

* Organisations with strict data segregation requirements that mandate physical isolation to preserve data integrity, or that require compliance with FedRAMP.  
* Organisations that need to use highly customised features that are not suited to a multi-tenant environment, such as custom procedures.

* For large-scale, mission-critical applications that require advanced security and 24x7 support.
* Organisations that require the highest level of uptime SLA.
