====
One of the great things about Aura is that it's 100% free to try out!
You can create a fully functioning graph without needing to pay a thing. 
After you've created your graph, you can decide if you want to upgrade to make use of Aura's paid for features (when you want to use it to connect to an application, or create a big graph).
You can compare the pricing plans here link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/[pricing]
Once you're signed up, you can start creating! 
You do that by creating an instance, an instance is like a home for your graph.

== To create a new instance

Once you are in your brand new, shiny Aura account, you'll see a button that says *new instance*.
Go ahead and press that!
You'll see a few options appear that you can choose from.
They are pretty self-explanatory. You can choose a Free instance (great for experimenting and learning).
Or, some paid for options.

. Select *New Instance*.
. Select your plan.
. Copy and store the instance's *password* or download the credentials as a `.txt` file.
Once you've noted or downloaded your credentials, the creation of your instance starts.

It shouldn't take too long, but we want to make it super fast whilst you use it in the future, so if it takes a few moments... that's ok, because in the future it won't lag! hehe. that's what the developers say. 
_It’s slow now because it’s saving all the speed for later._ heheh it's not too slow. it's _Starting slow to build suspense_



[NOTE]
======
You can create one Free instance per account.
======

NOTE: You can only set up one free instance
=== If you want to create more instances, just tap the "New instance" button
