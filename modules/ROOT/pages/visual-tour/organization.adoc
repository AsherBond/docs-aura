:description: This page introduces the console UI.

When setting up the Aura Console, you'll start by landing in an organization. Organizations are the top level of the console hierarchy and provide an overview of projects, users, billing, and security features.

If you've set up your Aura account from scratch, you'll automatically be assigned an organization as an admin. You can then create and manage multiple projects within this organization.

The new Aura console will initially name your organization with a default label, such as “Alex’s organization,” but you have the flexibility to change this name if you prefer.

*An image of the organization view here would be nice.
Also images of Projects, Users, and Settings.
Brief intros to those.*
