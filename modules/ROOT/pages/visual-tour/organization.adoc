:description: This page introduces the console UI.

If you’re setting up the Aura Console - you will land in an organization.

Organizations are at the top level of the console hierarchy.

Organization provides an overview of projects, users, billing, and security features.

If you have set up your Aura account from scratch, you’ll be an admin so you are automatically assigned an organization upon creating your account.

You can create and manage multiple projects within an organization.

The new Aura console will automatically name the organization, such as “Alex’s organization”. You can change the organization name. 

There can be multiple projects within an organization.


An image of the organization view here would be nice.
Also images of Projects, Users, and Settings.
Brief intros to those.
