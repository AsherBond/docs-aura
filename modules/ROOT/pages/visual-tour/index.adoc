= Get to know the console
:description: This page introduces the console UI.

When you log in, you’ll likely find yourself in a project. The Aura console is designed for intuitive navigation, allowing you to explore using clickable cards, breadcrumbs, and dropdown menus.

If you’re setting up the console, your starting point will be an organization. However, if an admin has invited you to a specific project, you’ll land directly in that project. The organization or project you’re currently viewing will always be displayed in the header of the console as breadcrumbs.

To switch between different organisations or projects, click on the organization name in the breadcrumbs. This will open a dropdown menu where you can see all the organisations and projects you have access to, making it easy to move between them.

Once inside an organization, you’ll see a list of projects displayed as cards. These cards provide a snapshot of each project, including the number of instances and members associated with it. Clicking on a project card will take you inside that project, where you can view existing instances or create new ones as needed.

== Comparison to the classic console

* Some features, such as metrics, have been moved to the left-hand side.
* Tenants are an evolution of projects.
* The new console’s left navigation now provides access to tools, marking a significant change from the classic console's concept of "opening" the instance.
* The process for creating an instance remains unchanged.

=== Data services : 

To get to your data, you'll need to head to a project and connect to an instance.

If your instance already contains data, you can start exploring it visually or querying it. If you need to import data, go to Explore and follow the instructions to bring in a dataset, such as Northwind. Exploring data is central to using Aura, so you'll always need to go to Explore for this purpose—unless you're an admin or operations person who only needs to manage the system without diving into the data itself.

=== Instances 

Expand an instance card to see what you can do, such as viewing metrics, taking snapshots, or pausing the instance—none of which require data.

To see the power of a graph database, you'll need some data in your instance. You can follow the workspace guide to get that set up. Once you're connected, you're ready to go. If you already have an instance with data in it, there's no need to start from scratch; you can jump right in and start working with your existing data.

After that you can switch between the different tabs for all the graph tools. 

Because you want to explore a particular data set and do some neat queries using Cypher.

You will be oriented from the section titles in the side panel.

Navigate via the breadcrumbs (organizations, projects, instances).
