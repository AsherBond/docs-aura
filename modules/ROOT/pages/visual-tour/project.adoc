:description: This page introduces projects.

If you were an existing user of Aura - it might be useful to think of tenants renamed as projects.

There can be multiple projects within an organization.

Projects can encompass one or multiple instances. 

You will see the instances listed - you can do actions on the cards from there (for all the instance actions such as pause / clone / etc https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/auradb/managing-databases/database-actions/)
