:description: This page introduces projects.


If you're an existing Aura user, consider that tenants are now referred to as projects.

An organization can have multiple projects, and each project can include one or more instances. You will see a list of instances, where you can perform actions such as pausing or cloning. For more details on these actions, visit https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/auradb/managing-databases/database-actions/.

* Images of the various exoanded things: Users, Roles, Billing, and Settings.
