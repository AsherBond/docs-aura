label:AuraDB-Virtual-Dedicated-Cloud[]

This section is cloud-agnostic and therefore applicable to all clouds.

The term “private link” refers to:

* Private Service Connect = Google Cloud platform
* PrivateLink = AWS
* Private Link = Azure

This tutorial walks through the process of setting up a private link connection to securely connect your application to an AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud environment. 
A private link provides secure network connectivity between your application and AuraDB without exposing traffic to the public internet.
Refer to Figure 1 for a visual representation of the network package traffic flow.

== Steps

[NOTE]
======
Thw dbid: abcd1234 and orch-id: 0000 are used in this tutorial. 
These are different in your AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud environment.
======

. The application initializes a driver connection to neo4j+s://abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io.
. The network layer then queries the DNS server to resolve the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (in this case, abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io) to its corresponding IP address.
. The Cloud Virtual Network private DNS is queried, and it resolves the FQDN to 10.10.10.10, based on the wildcard DNS A record created: *.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io -> 10.10.10.10
. The application's connection is directed to 10.10.10.10, which is the private link endpoint. 
From there, the private link endpoint forwards the network connection to the private ingress through the private link.
. The private ingress extracts the dbid from the FQDN and directs the connection to the appropriate Aura instance (dbid: abcd1234).
. The Aura instance responds by sending the Neo4j cluster routing table back to the application, which contains information about the available nodes and their roles (see Table 1 below).
. The application then selects an appropriate node to execute a read or write transaction. In the case of a write transaction, the application sends the transaction to abcd1234-core-1.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io.

Based on the type of transaction (read or write) the driver selects an appropriate node to execute a read or write transaction. 
The code has the ability to direct the transaction to the appropriate nodes this way.

. Similar to before, the Cloud Virtual Network private DNS is queried and resolves the FQDN to 10.10.10.10. The application's connection is sent to the private link endpoint (10.10.10.10), which forwards the network connection to the private ingress through the private link. 
The private ingress then directs the connection to the Aura instance with dbid: abcd1234.
. Finally, the write transaction is received and executed within the Aura instance with dbid: abcd1234.

== Summary

When you create a private link using the Aura console, the private ingress becomes accessible to all projects within the cloud provider’s VPC. 

*The private link maps to an Orchestra, not a project. 
You could have multiple orchestras (usually multiple regions)*

For example, if you’re using AWS, you can identify this private ingress by its unique name in your AWS environment.

First, create a private ingress service in Aura VPC, then create a cloud endpoint and try to connect to the service we have provided, then this private link will be accepted.
This can be completed on the Aura console.

And then there’s a trickier step, but it's the most important thing. 
*The private DNS.*
You should configure this private DNS.
If you are using AWS, then AWS will create this private DNS for you. 
For Google or Azure, you have to manually create this private DNS.
Add the Wildcard DNS entry *.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io and point it to the cloud IP endpoint.


== Cloud endpoints

A cloud endpoint is essentially a network forwarding rule. 
It receives network packets, but doesn't open them and forwards them to the Neo4j private ingress via the private link. 
However, the private ingress only accepts packets from a recognized FQDN.

For example, http://abcd1234-core-1.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io/

There might be some other instances running in the same customer Aura environment. 
We use this Access Point QDN (Qualified Domain Name) to figure out which Aura instance it is trying to reach.
[IMPORTANT]
====
Only FQDN is accepted and **not** the IP address.
====

== Private DNS

Once the private ingress, private link, and private endpoint with the DNS entry are configured, the application will attempt to reach the IP address.

And then it will try to go and check the private link, like “hey, what is the private DNS address for this AFQDN?”
Then the private DNS will tell the application, “you should go to 10.10.10 here. 
This is the IP address of the endpoint."
Then this endpoint will just forward everything to Aura. 

*Important: The private DNS only works for this single cloud VPC.*
Outside of this VPC that private DNS entry does not work, _that’s the reason why it’s called private DNS._

If your application is running in a different VPC, it will not be able to reach the endpoint. 
This is because there is no DNS resolution across VPCs. 
Setting up the private link within the same VPC is straightforward and typically succeeds without issues. However, configuring DNS for access across different VPCs or environments is more complex and requires careful setup.

If you want your application running on your own on-prem data centers you still can use 
private link.
But you don’t want to go to the internet and then back to your own Aura instance because it's unsafe (data leakage, unauthorized access, etc.) and the latency might be too long. 
If you still want applications running on your on-prem data center can reach out through this private link.

To enable communication from on-prem data centers, the first step is to create a cloud VPN or another type of secure connection between your on-prem network and the VPC that has the private link endpoint running in it. 
You also need to configure your DNS server so that traffic directed to the FQDN is forwarded to the endpoint’s IP address.

== Other info

* Database upload is not possible whilst the public traffic is disabled.
* Bloom - We display it clearly outside the VPC, and we should explain that to access it the VPN needs to be established in "split-mode"
* [BONUS] LOAD CSV - Can we show / display the path used ? this will help customers understand how and where to place their data
* [BONUS] SSO - I'd love us to show what route is necessary to reach the IdP
