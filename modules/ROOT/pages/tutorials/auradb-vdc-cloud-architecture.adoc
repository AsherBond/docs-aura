:description: What the cloud architecture looks like for AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud.

Let’s walk through the cloud architecture for AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud.
(This example covers an AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud instance on AWS, but the same applies for GCP and Azure.)

In AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud, you select the cloud provider and region of your choice, and we provision a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for you. 
This VPC is dedicated exclusively to your instance—no one else has access. 
Once the VPC is set up, you can designate one or two administrators who will receive access invitations as soon as the deal is finalized.

The VPC is initially empty when provisioned. 
It doesn’t run any Aura instances by default—you create and manage those.

After signing into the Aura platform, you gain access to the Aura console. 
A login password will be provided through the support portal. 
Upon logging in, you’ll see an empty console with no instances yet. 
From there, you can create Aura instances either via the console or through the Aura APIs.

Every Aura instance you create is automatically deployed as a 3-node cluster across different availability zones (AZs). 
AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud architecture is only available in regions with a minimum of three availability zones. 
Each cluster includes one leader and two followers, each running in its own zone. 
This design ensures high availability, supporting an SLA of 3.5 and enabling self-healing during upgrades or scaling operations.

All traffic between your application and your VPC—represented by the left-hand box—is encrypted at rest. 
A secure connection is established between your VPC and the Neo4j VPC, with the option to disable public access entirely. 
This setup allows you to create a private link for secure traffic between your VPC and the Neo4j VPC, ensuring a private, encrypted tunnel.

By default, all communications between your VPC and Neo4j VPCs use the latest version of TLS, ensuring top-tier security.

Key features:

* All communications are secure.
* Traffic is encrypted at rest.
* You have the option to create private links and disable public access for an end-to-end private connection between your VPC and the VPC we provision for you.
