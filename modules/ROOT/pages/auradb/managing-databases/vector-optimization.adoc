== Overview

Vector optimized configuration is a feature that reserves memory for vector indexes, enhancing performance for vector-based operations. This configuration is designed for applications requiring optimized support for vector data and is available on select AuraDB tiers and instance configurations.

== Availability

Vector optimized configuration is accessible under the following conditions:

- *Minimum Instance Size*: 4GB RAM or above
- *Supported Neo4j Version*: Neo4j Version 5 only
- *Cluster Configurations*: Single-member or three-member clusters
- *Cloud Provider and Region*: Available on all supported cloud providers and regions
- *Applicable Usage*: UPX only (Unified Property Index)

== Enabling Vector Optimized Configuration

The Vector Optimized Configuration option can be enabled during the *instance creation* process. By default:

- The instance size is set to *4GB* for all customers.
- The vector optimized configuration toggle is *off* by default but can be switched on if the selected instance size is 4GB or higher.

=== Steps to Enable Vector Optimized Configuration

1. *Begin Instance Creation*:
   - Select your desired AuraDB tier and instance size. Note that the vector optimized configuration is available only for instances *4GB and above*.
  
2. *Locate the “Additional Settings” Section*:
   - After selecting instance details, expand the *Additional Settings* section where the *Vector optimized configuration* option appears.

3. *Toggle Vector Optimized Configuration*:
   - If the instance is 4GB or larger, the toggle can be switched on to enable vector indexing.
   - *Tooltip Guidance*: Hovering over the toggle will display the message: “4GB memory is required for the vector index configuration.”
   - *Note*: Instances below 4GB do not support vector optimization, and the toggle will remain inactive.

4. *Configuration Status in Instance Details*:
   - Post-creation, users can view the vector configuration status within *Instance Details*.
   - The configuration status will display as either “Yes” or “No” under *Vector Optimized Configuration*.
   - *Instance Resizing*: Reducing the instance size below 4GB will automatically disable the vector optimization and Graph Data Science (GDS) capabilities.

== Cloning and Vector Optimized Configuration

Neo4j Aura offers two cloning options with different behaviors regarding configuration inheritance:

=== Clone to New

- *Configuration Settings*: Cloned instances will retain the same vector and GDS configuration settings as the original instance.
- *Vector Optimization*: The vector optimized configuration status will match the original instance unless manually changed during the cloning process.

=== Clone to Existing

- *Configuration Settings*: Cloning into an existing instance does not carry over the vector and GDS configurations of the original instance.
- *Warning Message*: If the original instance has vector or GDS configurations applied, a warning message will inform the user:
- *Warning Text*: “Configurations are not applied to existing instances.”
