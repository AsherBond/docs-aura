secondaries: part of scaling and performance initiative at neo4j
it adds an extension of a database

Because they don't necessarily need to get started with secondaries, and not everyone needs them

It's for read intensive projects e.g. for analytics companies that are giving people recommendations with less write actions.

Makes it speedy to read from the database, b/c if someone is read & writing it can get slow if thereâ€™s lots of reads.

It means that in high read projects there's no bottlenecks, and companies can do more reads batch processing.

If a company was to do a lot of writing and reading then it could potentially slow down everything.

Simple fixed routing?
