:description: This section covers changing transaction log enrichment mode using the Aura Console.

Change Data Capture tracks changes to your data by querying the transaction logs for Creates, Updates and Deletes, so that you can update other applications or data sources.

For more information see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cdc/current[Neo4j DBMS -> Change Data Capture (CDC)].

Log enrichment mode can be set to `OFF`, `DIFF` or `FULL`. 
For more information see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cdc/current/getting-started/enrichment-mode/[Neo4j DBMS -> CDC -> Enrichment mode].

== Modifying log enrichment mode from within the Aura Console

View an instanceâ€™s current log enrichment mode by clicking on an instance in the Aura Console. 

[NOTE]
====
The default log enrichment mode is `OFF` and CDC is disabled unless set as `DIFF` or `FULL`.
====

Only Admins can change the log enrichment mode. 
If log enrichment mode is changed from `DIFF` or `FULL` to `OFF`, applications dependent on CDC stop working. 
For more information see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cdc/current/getting-started/enrichment-mode/#_disabling_log_enrichment[Neo4j DBMS -> CDC -> Disabling Log Enrichment].

== Performing a restore in Aura with log enrichment mode enabled

If you take a snapshot and restore it to the same instance, or create a new instance from that snapshot, by default log enrichment mode will be set to `OFF`. 
If the original status of that instance had log enrichment mode set to `DIFF` or `FULL`, the status changes. 
You need to proactively enable it.

CDC assumes that changes can be represented as a continuous stream, each new change building on top of the state of the previous changes. 
Restoring a Neo4j database breaks this continuous stream. 
See the implications documented in link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cdc/current[Neo4j DBMS -> CDC -> Backup and Restore Operations] before proceeding with restoring your backup.

== Pause and resume

This is currently unsupported for databases enabled with CDC.

== Design considerations for applications with CDC in Aura

When designing applications that query using CDC's procedures, those applications track their position in the stream of changes using a cursor. 
The cursor is valid for a limited time. For more information see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cdc/current[Neo4j DBMS -> CDC -> Transaction log retention].

Developers should therefore consider high availability for their application so that continuity is maintained in querying in the event the application fails. 
For example, use Kubernetes to automatically restart the application or a 3rd party product like Apache Kafka or Confluent.
