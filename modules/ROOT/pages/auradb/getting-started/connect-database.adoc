:description: This page describes how to connect to an instance using Neo4j AuraDB.

There are a few different methods of connecting to an instance:

You will be prompted to connect to an instance when you navigate to the Explore tab or the Query tab. 

== To open an instance from Explore or Query

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/?product=aura-db[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. You are prompted to choose a connection method
. Enter the *Database user* and *Password* credentials in the window that opens. 
These are the same credentials you stored when xref:auradb/getting-started/create-database.adoc[creating the instance].
. Select *Connect*.

|Protocol
|Don't worry about this and just use the default if you are a new user of Aura. Protocols are mainly for server-side routing vs client-side routing. We've seperated protocol and connection URL. The main reason for this, is being able to change these things independently. Users may want to use different protocols for the same instance URL, for example they get client-side routing with neo4j+s (better for clusters and single servers) or have a direct connection to the instance using bolt+s (not the default as it's less flexible).

|Connection URL 
|You can get this from your instance details 

|Database user 
|Neo4j by default

|Password 
|You are given the password when you initially create the instance

|Single sign-on 
|If this is set up, you can use SSO.

== Neo4j Desktop

You can connect AuraDB instances to the Neo4j Desktop application, allowing the ability to have a single portal for interacting with all instances of Neo4j, whether local or located in the cloud.

To connect to an instance using Neo4j Desktop:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/?product=aura-db[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Copy the *Connection URI* of the instance you want to connect to. The URI is below the instance status indicator.
. In Neo4j Desktop, select the *Projects* tab and select an existing project or create a new one.
. Select the *Add* dropdown and choose *Remote connection*.
. Enter a name for the instance and enter the URL from the Neo4j Aura console from the second step.
Once complete, select *Next*.
. With *Username/Password* selected, enter your credentials and select *Next*.
These are the same credentials you stored when xref:auradb/getting-started/create-database.adoc[creating the instance].
. When available, activate the connection by clicking the *Connect* button.

== Connect to recent instances

You can also use the connection banner, which is accessible inside each tool.

Click on *Status* and from there a drop down of options - you can perform actions such as connect / disconnect or connect to instances you recently connected to.
