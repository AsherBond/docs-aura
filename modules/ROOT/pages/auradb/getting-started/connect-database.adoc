= Connect to an instance
:description: This page describes how to connect to an instance using Neo4j AuraDB.

To start interacting with the data within an instance, you'll need to connect to it. 

There are a few different ways to connect to an instance:

* You are prompted to *choose a connection method* when you navigate to *Explore* or *Query*.
* Use the connection banner from within *Explore* or *Query*.

|Protocol
|_Don't worry about this and just use the default if you are a new user of Aura._ 
Protocols are mainly for server-side routing vs client-side routing. 
We've seperated protocol and connection URL, the main reason for this, is being able to change these things independently. Users may want to use different protocols for the same instance URL, for example they get client-side routing with `neo4j+s` (better for clusters and single servers) or have a direct connection to the instance using `bolt+s` (not the default as it's less flexible).

|Connection URL 
|Get this from the instance details provided when the instance is created. URL specific the location of the resource on the internet.

|Database user 
|Neo4j by default.
_Don't worry about this and just use the default if you are a new user of Aura._ 

|Password 
|Get this from the instance details provided when the instance is created.

|Single sign-on 
|If SSO you have set up SSO, you can use SSO.
